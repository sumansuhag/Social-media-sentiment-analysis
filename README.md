# Social-media-sentiment-analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on tweets or Facebook
posts using machine learning techniques. Clean
and preprocess the text data to remove noise and
tokenize the text into meaningful features. Utilize
models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep
learning architectures like RNNs or Transformers to
classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral).
Evaluate the model's performance using standard
metrics to gauge accuracy and effectiveness in
determining the sentiment of social media posts.
This analysis aims to provide insights into the
overall sentiment expressed in the dataset.
